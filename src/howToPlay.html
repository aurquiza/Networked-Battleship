    	<p> <strong>How to play</strong> 
    		<br>
    		Battleship is a guessing game consisting of two players. The objective of the game <br> 
    		is to be the first player to sink all of their opponents ships. There are two grids. <br>
    		The ocean grid and targeting grid. Players place their ships anywhere on the grid  <br>
    		horizontally or vertically. Alternating turns, one at a time players attack each other by <br>
    		calling out a position on the targeting grid by matching a row and column. For example, G5. <br>
    		If there is a piece of the ship in that position it is a hit, else if the space is empty <br>
    		it is an miss and the board gets updated as such. When all of the squares of a ship have <br>
    		been hit, the ship is sunk. If at the end of a round all of one player's ships have been <br>
    		sunk, the game ends and the other player wins. <br>
